# Podcast Analyzer

## Synopsis

Reads podcast RSS feeds to determine average number of minutes uploaded per week to better adjust listening habits. Optimize the number of podcasts to which you subscribe so as to never run out or fall behind in your listening.

## Dependencies

You will need Python 2 to execute this script.

The [lxml](http://lxml.de/) package is necessary for this script (the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/lxml/lxml)). To simplify setup and usage, we have included a legal binary distribution compiled from [version 3.6.4](https://github.com/lxml/lxml/releases/tag/lxml-3.6.4), so there is no need to install anything.
